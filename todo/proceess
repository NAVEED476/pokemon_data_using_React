there are different steps were involved r=to create a todo application in react 


first we need a form to give input 

and one button

create a state using usesate to maintain the state

initially it is a form so we need to create a function for this to prevent changing in the form =>  onsubmit{function-name}
in the same function use call back to empty all the time when i hit enter button

use onchnage method to make changes check once after all the steps does it working or not 
for onchange create a function for targting the inout value
cosnt changebutton = (e)=>{
    setInput(e.target.value)  where setInput is the usestatecall back function
}
